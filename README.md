## R1 - Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.
I am building this particular app to address the problem of a large retail sales company with an ineffcient new employee training system. The problem is that a mentor and new employees use a group journal which is a notebook to exchange feedback, which is inefficient and unsuitable for storing and sharing information.<br>
By developing this app, manual information exchage is no longer necessary, and feedback between a mentor and new employees can be smoothly conducted on the app.,<br>
Other employees can view the conversation on a unified platform, so when they comment on a new employee, they can communicate with them while understanding the corrent situation. This app will improve the efficiency of training new employees and also make data management easier.

## R2 - Why is it a problem that needs solving?
There are several problems with managing group journals in notebooks. the problems that require solutions are:<br>

- Inefficiency: Exchanging feedback using a notebook is inefficient because only the person who owns the notebook can write and view it. Manual work is time-consuming and limits the opportunity for other employees to view it.

- Data Management: It is inefficient for a company to keep multiple notebooks, and searching for past information becomes manual and time-consuming.　By managing data, a campany can quickly search for past information and use it for training new empolyees　in the next period.

- Limited collaboration: The current method is inefficient as oppotunities for other employees to view the group journal are limited. Additionally, it is difficult to grasp the status of new employee training for all employees. By having a unified platform, all employees can view the group journal, and there is the advantage that they can communicate after understanding the situation.
